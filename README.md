# Toxic Comment Classification Challenge

## Overview

This project is a solution to the [Jigsaw Toxic Comment Classification Challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/jigsaw-toxic-comment-classification-challenge), hosted on Kaggle. The goal is to develop a model that can classify online comments into different categories of toxicity.

## Dataset

The dataset consists of comments labeled for different types of toxicity, including:

- Toxic
- Severe Toxic
- Obscene
- Threat
- Insult
- Identity Hate

The dataset is available on Kaggle and includes both training and test sets.

## Methodology

The project follows these steps:

1. **Data Exploration:**

   - Checking dataset structure
   - Visualizing word frequency and toxicity distribution

2. **Preprocessing:**

   - Text cleaning (removing punctuation, stopwords, and special characters)
   - Tokenization and stemming/lemmatization
   - Converting text to numerical representations using TF-IDF or embeddings

3. **Modeling:**

   - Training machine learning models such as Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, or deep learning models like LSTMs and Transformers (e.g., BERT)
   - Hyperparameter tuning and cross-validation

4. **Evaluation:**

   - Performance assessment using metrics like AUC-ROC, accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score
   - Confusion matrices and classification reports

5. **Prediction & Submission:**

   - Making predictions on the test dataset
   - Formatting and submitting results to Kaggle

## Requirements

To run this project, install the following dependencies:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn tensorflow torch transformers
```

## Usage

To execute the notebook:

1. Download the dataset from Kaggle.
2. Run the notebook step by step.
3. Modify hyperparameters and try different models for better performance.

## Results & Findings

- Toxicity classes are highly imbalanced, most comments are not toxic,
and some categories like threat and identity hate have very few
positive examples.
- There are comments with misspellings, non-standard grammar, and
slang that make preprocessing more crucial
- Single comment can belong to several categories.

## Future Improvements

- Experiment with different architectures such as Transformer-based models.
- Improve text preprocessing techniques.
- Perform data augmentation to balance the dataset.
